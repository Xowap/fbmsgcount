    <h1>Facebook Messages Count &mdash; Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their
        'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information
        security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a
        single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear
        understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in
        accordance with our website.</p>

    <h2>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our app?</h2>

    <p>This application retrieves the number of messages that you exchanged with each of your friends, as well
    as some basic information about your friends, like their name.</p>

    <h2>When do we collect information?</h2>

    <p>We collect that information once you complete the Facebook Login, and every time you reload the page or refresh
    the list.</p>

    <h2>How do we use your information?</h2>

    <p>The information is used purely for display purposes, and is never sent to anyone, including the Author of this
    application. The processing of information happens in the user's web browser, thus none of it is sent to a the
    application's servers or a third party.</p>

    <h2>How do we protect visitor information?</h2>

    <p>No information is stored. All information acquired from Facebook is protected by a SSL/TLS encryption.</p>

    <h2>Do we use 'cookies'?</h2>

    <p>We do not use cookies for any purposes</p>

    <h2>Third Party Disclosure</h2>

    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable
        information.
    </p>

    <h2>Third party links</h2>

    <p>We do not include or offer third party products or services on our website.</p>

    <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online
        services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or
        company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally
        identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
        exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with
        this policy. - See more at:
        http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

    <h3>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Users can visit our site anonymously</li>
        <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first
            significant page after entering our website.</li>
        <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified
            above.</li>
        <li>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page</li>
        <li>Users are able to change their personal information by logging in to their Facebook account</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h2>

    <p>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do
        Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
    </p>

    <h2>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h2>

    <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking</p>

    <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>

    <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the
        Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the
        nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and
        online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<p>

    <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>

    <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United
        States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
        around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is
        critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

    <h3>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following
        responsive action, should a data breach occur:</h3>

    <p>We will notify the users via in site notification within 7 business days</p>

    <p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a
        right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
        This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
        individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by
        data processors.
